 Project Title : Pet Symptom Analyzer 

 Project Description :
The Pet Symptom Analyzer is a Java-based desktop application designed to help pet owners identify potential health issues in their pets by analyzing symptoms. The application provides a questionnaire that the user answers based on their pet's symptoms, and it predicts possible diseases. It also includes a feature to suggest veterinarians in the user's city.

 Key Features :
1.  Symptom Questionnaire :
   - A series of symptom-related questions specific to different diseases (e.g., Parvovirus, Distemper, Kennel Cough, Rabies).
   - Users input their responses to determine the most likely condition affecting their pet.

2.  Condition Prediction :
   - The application analyzes the user's responses and predicts the most likely disease based on symptom matching.
   - Provides a summary of the possible condition and advises consultation with a veterinarian.

3.  Doctor Suggestion :
   - Users can enter their city and other pet details, and the application suggests veterinarians in their area.
   - The application retrieves doctor details from a MySQL database and displays them to the user.

4.  Health Tips :
   - The application displays periodic health tips for dog care to the user, enhancing user experience.

 Technologies Used :
-  Java : Core programming language used for the application's logic and UI development.
-  Swing : Java Swing was used for creating the graphical user interface, providing a desktop application feel.
-  MySQL : Database used for storing pet details and doctor information. JDBC was utilized for connecting and interacting with the database.

 Software Development Aspects :
-  GUI Development : Designed an intuitive and user-friendly interface using Java Swing components.
-  Database Integration : Integrated a MySQL database to store and retrieve data dynamically based on user input.
-  Algorithm Implementation : Developed an algorithm to process user inputs and predict the petâ€™s condition based on predefined symptoms.
-  Error Handling : Incorporated error handling mechanisms, especially around database operations, to ensure smooth application performance.
-  User Experience : Added features such as dynamic health tips and image integration to make the application engaging and informative.

 Challenges and Solutions :
-  Database Connectivity : Ensuring reliable connection and smooth operation with the MySQL database, including handling SQL exceptions.
-  User Input Validation : Implemented validation checks to ensure the user inputs valid and meaningful data throughout the application.

 Outcome :
The Pet Symptom Analyzer serves as a practical tool for pet owners to monitor their pets' health and find nearby veterinary care. It successfully demonstrates skills in software development, including GUI design, database management, and problem-solving.
